# Changelog

All meaningful releases on `claude/build-word-clone-cXSXu`. Versions
follow `RW_BUILD.version` in `app.js`. Cache key in
`sw.js VERSION` is in lock-step.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-02 · cache `rwd-v9`

UI polish + plumbing.

- Mobile ribbon now collapses to a single horizontally-scrolling row
  on screens ≤ 720 px. `display: contents` on `.group-row` and
  `flex-direction: row` on `.group` flatten the per-tab structure
  into one row regardless of how many controls a tab has.
- Service worker rewritten to **network-first for every same-origin
  GET**, with the cache as offline fallback. Eliminates the stale-
  asset reload-twice problem.
- `RW_BUILD` constant introduced as the single source of truth for
  the displayed version, build date, and cache key. About dialog
  reads from it.
- Backstage rewritten as Word-style two-pane layout with 11 sections
  (Home / New / Open / Save / Print / Share / Cloud sync / Export /
  Info / Tools / About) plus a search box that filters every section.
- Every ribbon tab reorganised: Lists split out of Paragraph on
  Home, Page-setup split into Margins / Flow on Layout, View split
  into Zoom / Theme / Show / Modes / Read / Writing aids / Macros /
  Markup, References created as its own tab.
- Insert tab consolidated into Pages / Tables / Illustrations /
  Media / Links / Header & Footer / Text / Symbols / Forms / Editing
  with two inline ribbon dropdowns (Pictures, Shapes).
- Ribbon double-click toggles collapse; single click on collapsed
  ribbon switches and re-expands.
- File menu, ARCHITECTURE.md, FEATURES.md, CHANGELOG.md, and
  CONTRIBUTING.md added.
