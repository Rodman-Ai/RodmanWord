# RodmanWord

A Microsoft Word–style document editor that runs entirely in the
browser. No backend, no build step, no framework. Drop the static
HTML / CSS / JS files on any static host and it works — including
GitHub Pages.

After ~250 features, RodmanWord covers the day-to-day Word feel
(File / Home / Insert / References / Layout / Review / View ribbon
tabs, threaded comments, track changes, headers and footers, citations
and bibliography, equations, charts, multi-format save / load) plus a
handful of things modern competitors offer: WebRTC peer-to-peer
collaboration, GitHub-Gist cloud sync, smart-compose ghost text,
cover pages, a brand kit, dark / sepia / high-contrast themes, and
offline support via a service worker.

> **Live demo:** auto-deploys to GitHub Pages from `main` /
> the active feature branch.
> **Version**: see About RodmanWord — pulled from
> `RW_BUILD` in `app.js`.

## Format support

| Format | Save / export | Open / import |
|---|---|---|
| `.rwd` (native JSON) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.rwd.enc` (AES-GCM) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.docx` (OOXML) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.pdf` | ✓ | ✓ (text only) |
| `.html` / `.htm` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.md` | ✓ (with optional YAML frontmatter) | ✓ |
| `.txt` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.odt` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.rtf` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.epub` | ✓ | ✓ (chapters as one body) |
| `.adoc` (AsciiDoc) | ✓ | — |
| `.tex` (LaTeX) | ✓ | — |

The DOCX writer + reader is in `docx.js`, the PDF writer + extractor
in `pdfio.js`, every other format lives in `interop.js`. None of them
have external dependencies — `docx.js` includes its own STORED-method
ZIP writer (and a ZIP reader using the browser's `DecompressionStream`
for DEFLATE), `pdfio.js` writes PDF 1.4 against the standard 14 Type-1
fonts, and `interop.js` reuses `RodmanDocx`'s ZIP for ODT and EPUB.

## Run locally

```bash
# any static server works
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push to GitHub.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions**.
3. The included `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes the repo
   root on every push to `main` (and the active feature branch).

## PWA / offline

- A web manifest (`manifest.webmanifest`) makes RodmanWord installable.
- A service worker (`sw.js`) runs **network-first** for every same-
  origin GET, with the cache as an offline fallback. After the first
  visit the editor works fully offline. Cache version is bumped in
  lock-step with `RW_BUILD.cache` in `app.js`.

## Browser support

Tested on the latest desktop and mobile Chrome / Edge / Safari /
Firefox. Hard requirements: `contenteditable`, modern CSS
(custom properties, flex / grid, `:has()`), `crypto.subtle`,
`SubtleCrypto.deriveKey` (for `.rwd.enc`), `DecompressionStream`
(for DOCX import). Optional: WebRTC (collab), File System Access
API (Save to file…), Web Speech API (read-aloud + dictation).
